We used Beaglebone Black as our main processor, and two Arduino-based co-processors. \\
Beaglebone Black powered by AM335x processor from Texas Instrument, which is based on ARM-A8 architecture. We runs Linux operation system on this board. The reason why we choose this controller rather than normal MCU is that, general purpose operation system has more potential both on performance, including image processing, and on connectivity, including talk with other smart home appliances or supervirsory computer. \\
We did not run strict RTOS (Real-time operation system) like FreeRTOS, QNX or WindRiver, so in order to improve performance in timing-required and massive-computing tasks, we also used two Arduino MCUs as co-processor, and use SPI protocol to communicate with main processor Beaglebone Black.  \\
